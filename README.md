# TU Graz Typst theme

This is a theme inspired by the TUGraz Metropolis LaTeX theme, with some added nice features.

The flake provides a Dev-Shell and includes required fonts.
The theme is not packaged yet, because in their great wisdom, Typst devs decided to look in `$XDG_DATA_HOME` for packages instead of `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`
